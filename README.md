This laravel web application has the following:

- User can login and/or register 
- Registered users are by default authors and can create new blogs
- All blogs are listed on the landing page and can be viewed by all
- Only logged in users can post comments and/or rate a blog
- Only the author of the blog can edit and/or delete a blog
- Registered users have also the option of view the list of all their blogs only
